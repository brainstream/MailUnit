<BLOCKQUOTE>
A message consists of header fields (collectively called "the header
section of the message") followed, optionally, by a body.  The header
section is a sequence of lines of characters with special syntax as
defined in this specification.  The body is simply a sequence of
characters that follows the header section and is separated from the
header section by an empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding
the CRLF).

header field.s are lines beginning with a field name, followed by a
colon (":"), followed by a field body, and terminated by CRLF.

<P>... the field body portion of a header field. can be split into a
multiple-line representation; this is called "folding".  The general
rule is that wherever this specification allows for folding white
space (not simply WSP characters), a CRLF may be inserted before any WSP.</P>
<P>... The process of moving from this folded multiple-line representation
of a header field. to its single line representation is called
"unfolding".  Unfolding is accomplished by simply removing any CRLF
that is immediately followed by WSP.</P>
